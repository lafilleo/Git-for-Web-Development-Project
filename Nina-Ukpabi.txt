Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	An inline element stays within the boundaries required and doesn't start on a new line (span, a) while a block element takes up as much space as is available and starts on a new line (like div, article, p, hr).
	
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
	An absolutely positioned element will appear on screen in relation to whatever is around it.
	
    3. How do I make an  element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
	I think if you don't specify anything EXCEPT the width of an element, the rest should work around it? Maybe using relative positioning over absolute? Will look into this further!
	
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	- Display block elements: div, section, header
	- Display inline elements: span, code
	- Display inline-block element: img
	
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
 The box model is a simplified description of the shape resulting from the "wrapping" of margins (the outmost), borders, padding, and content (innermost). It's meant to structurally define spacing "rules" for the layout of a page. 
To "fix" the box model, you can use the following equations for determining TEW (total element width) and TEH (total element height):
TEW = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin
TEH = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin
